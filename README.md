# OMS-System
For ISD 2019 (Group 6)

How to run this system successfully (hopefully):
1. Download all the files in the zip file (x1 folder for the project and x1 for the database)
2. Place those 2 folders in the correct destinations
	2.1 For the system folder --> C:\Users\"Insert_Name_Here"\Documents\GitHub\OMS-System
	2.2 For the database folder --> C:\Users\"Insert_Name_Here"\AppData\Roaming\NetBeans\Derby
3. Alternatively, you can clone the project in GitHub (for the system folder only)
4. Run NetBeans (recommended version 8.2)
5. Open the "OMS-System" project in NetBeans
6. Build and run the project and see if it is successful or not...
7. Good Luck!
